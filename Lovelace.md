Ada Lovelace

Ada Lovelace was a pioneer of early computng. The daughter of an English lord/poet, she lived in the 19th century, 100 years before the modern computer. She learned mathematics from her mother who didn't want her to become like her father, a poet.

She worked throughout her life with Charles Babbage, on his proposed computer, called the Analytical Engine. She arguably was the first programmer, as she wrote algorythms meant to be carried out by the machine. She died of cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.
